## Introduction
Loan approval is a critical task for financial institutions. This project uses machine learning to automate the loan approval process based on applicant information, such as education, employment status, and other relevant features.

## Project Overview
This project can be broken down into several key steps:

- **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** The dataset is loaded, and an initial exploration is conducted, ensuring data consistency and quality.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Categorical variables are transformed into numerical representations, and the target variable is defined.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Basic data analysis and visualization are used to understand the data distribution and correlations between variables.

- **Data Scaling:** Features are scaled using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

- **Model Building:** The project explores different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

- **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using classification reports, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/assiltarhouni/Loan-Approval-Predictive-Model.git`

2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook loan_approval_project.ipynb`

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing values are handled.
- Categorical variables are one-hot encoded.
- The target variable is defined.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
- Basic data analysis helps understand the distribution of approved loans.
- A correlation matrix is visualized to assess relationships between variables.

## Model Building
- Three machine learning models are explored: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Model Evaluation
- Classification reports are generated for each model, providing insights into their performance.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
